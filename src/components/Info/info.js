              <p>I am currently enrolled in a Front-End Web Development Bootcamp, due to finish at the end of March 2023. During this rigorous and fast-paced course, I have learnt the practical and technical skills needed to build robust front-end web applications.</p>
              <p>I have gained proficiency in numerous technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and React, and plan to build on these skills in the coming months.</p>
              <p>Please lake a look at the
                <span><Link to="/projects" end> Projects page</Link></span> to view a selection of my work.
              </p>
              <p>Having worked in fundraising for the past twelve years, leading teams to achieve excellence and consistently deliver growth, I believe that my skills and personality are well suited to a career in web development. I am highly organised with good problem-solving skills and the ability to manage a wide variety of projects at one time. I look forward to putting these skills to use as I continue on this journey!</p>
